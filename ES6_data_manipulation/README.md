The error indicates that there is an issue with the ESLint plugin eslint-plugin-jest, particularly with the rule prefer-todo in your setup. The problem arises when ESLint tries to parse a CallExpression in your file 7-main.js and encounters an undefined property type.

Hereâ€™s how to resolve this:

Steps to Fix the Issue:
1. Update eslint-plugin-jest:
This issue might be caused by an outdated version of eslint-plugin-jest. Update it to the latest version:

bash
Copier le code
npm install eslint-plugin-jest@latest --save-dev
2. Review ESLint Configuration:
Check your ESLint configuration file (likely .eslintrc.json or .eslintrc.js) and verify the plugins and rules. Ensure that eslint-plugin-jest is correctly included under plugins and extends.

Example .eslintrc.json:

json
Copier le code
{
  "env": {
    "es6": true,
    "node": true,
    "jest": true
  },
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:jest/recommended"],
  "plugins": ["jest"],
  "rules": {
    "jest/prefer-todo": "off"
  }
}
3. Disable the Problematic Rule (Temporary):
If the issue persists, you can disable the specific Jest rule causing the issue (jest/prefer-todo) in your ESLint configuration:

json
Copier le code
"rules": {
  "jest/prefer-todo": "off"
}
Then re-run your tests:

bash
Copier le code
npm run full-test
4. Analyze 7-main.js:
The error points to line 23 of your file 7-main.js. Open the file and check for any syntax that might confuse ESLint, such as invalid Jest methods or unusual constructs. For example:

javascript
Copier le code
test('example test', () => {
  // Check for invalid or undefined constructs
});
5. Reinstall Dependencies (Optional):
If the issue persists after the above steps, you might be dealing with corrupted or incompatible dependencies. Clean your node_modules folder and reinstall:

bash
Copier le code
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
Further Debugging:
If you still encounter the error, you can test with a minimal ESLint configuration to isolate the issue.
Ensure your Node.js version is up to date, as certain packages require newer versions of Node.js.
